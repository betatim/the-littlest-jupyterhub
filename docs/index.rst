=======================
The Littlest JupyterHub
=======================

A simple `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ distribution for
a small (0-50) number of users on a single server.

Development Status
==================

This project is currently in **alpha** state. Most things work, but we might
still make breaking changes that have no clear upgrade pathway. We are targetting
a v0.1 release sometime in mid-August 2018. Follow `this milestone <https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/milestone/1>`_
to see progress towards the release!

Installation
============

The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH) can run on any server that is running at least
Ubuntu 18.04. We have a bunch of tutorials to get you started.

- Tutorials to create a new server from scratch on a cloud provider & run TLJH
  on it. These are **recommended** if you do not have much experience setting up
  servers.

- :ref:`tutorials/custom`.
  You should use this if your cloud provider does not already have a direct tutorial,
  or if you have experience setting up servers.

Once you are ready to run your server for real,
it's a good idea to proceed directly to :doc:`howto/https`.

Tutorials
=========

Tutorials guide you step-by-step through accomplishing a specific task.

Often, your issues are not related to TLJH itself but to the cloud provider
your server is running on. We have some documentation on common issues you
might run into with various providers and how to fix them. We welcome contributions
here to better support your favorite provider!
